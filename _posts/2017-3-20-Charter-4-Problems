# Solutions To Problem From Chapter 4 Of Object Oriented Programming in C++


### A phone number, such as (212) 767-8900, can be thought of as having three parts: the area code (212), the exchange (767), and the number (8900). Write a program that uses a structure to store these three parts of a phone number separately. Call the structure phone. Create two structure variables of type phone. Initialize one, and have the user input a number for the other one. Then display both numbers. The interchange might look like this:
### Enter your area code, exchange, and number: 415 555 1212
### My number is (212) 767-8900
### Your number is (415) 555-1212



#### Solution:

##### This problem is way to similar to the example where we stored model number, part number and part cost in a structure. In this case we will cout "(212) 767-8900" for my number and then cout the members of the structure that are modified by the user using input. So, replace moder number with area code, part number with exchange, and part cost with the number. 



```C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


struct phone
{
int areacode;                                                         //Three members of structure called phone.       
int exchange; 
int number; 
};


int main()
{

phone phoneuser;                                                      //Define a variable phoneuser of type phone

cout << "Please enter your area code, exchange, and number";

cin >> phoneuser.area >> phoneuser.exchange >> phoneuser.number;      //We know this is the only way to access structure members
                                                                      //Because structure members are of user-defined data type
cout << "My number is: " << "(212) 767-8900";                           
cout << "Your number is: " << "(" << phoneuser.areacode << ")" << phoneuser.exchange << "-" << phoneuser.number << endl;
 
return 0;
} 
```
